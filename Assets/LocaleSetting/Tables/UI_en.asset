      convey information and emotions through language, text, and behavior to achieve
      collaborative transactions and other business objectives. Its essence is value
      transmission and consensus building. It can be divided by audience into internal
      team collaboration and external customer public relations; by form into formal
      contracts and reports versus informal social interactions. The core focus is
      on reducing information disparities to facilitate the realization of goals.

      Records of the Grand Historian: Biographies
      of Merchants: Panyu "is also a major metropolis, gathering pearls, rhinoceros
      horn, tortoiseshell, fruits, and cloth." Book of Han: Geography: Panyu "is
      located near the sea, abundant in rhinoceros, elephants, tortoiseshell, pearls,
      silver, copper, fruits, and cloth. Merchants from Central China often become
      wealthy here; Panyu is one such metropolis." Sima Qian described Lingnan during
      the Nanyue Kingdom period, while Ban Gu depicted Lingnan after its incorporation
      into the Han dynasty, when inland merchants increasingly traded there, and
      commodities expanded to include silver and copper. Archaeologists have found
      glass beads in Han tombs in Guangzhou and Hepu, resembling ancient Western
      glass. A gray pottery tripod unearthed in Sumatra bears an inscription dating
      to the fourth year of the Chuyuan era (45 BCE) of Emperor Yuan of Han. Incense
      used in censers from Guangzhou Han tombs mostly originated from Southeast Asia.

      Eastern
      Han

      Yang Fu of Xiadutou Village, Panyu, wrote in Strange Things of the
      Southern Frontier: "Tortoiseshell resembles a turtle and inhabits the South
      Sea." "Rhinoceros horn has a special radiance, with white lines running straight
      from base to tip, known as ''piercing-heaven rhinoceros horn.''" Jar people
      "have exceptionally white teeth and eyes, with jet-black faces and bodies that
      gleam. They serve as slaves, strong and diligent," likely referring to Malays
      traded as commodities to China.

      Book of the Later Han: "During Emperor
      Huan''s reign, countries west of Funan, such as Tianzhu (India) and Daqin (Rome),
      sent tribute via the South Sea after multiple translations. Since then, foreign
      merchants have flooded Yangyue (Guangdong)."

      Guangzhou''s Xianggang
      Mountain: "The Nanyue King''s Tomb yielded many overseas items, such as ivory,
      frankincense, silver boxes, and gold floral ornaments."

      Dragon Mother

      Originating
      in Deqing Yuecheng, also known as Deqing Dragon Mother or Yuecheng Dragon Mother.
      Enfeoffed since the Han dynasty, Emperor Gaozu granted her the title Lady Chengxi.
      Shen Huaiyuan''s Records of Nanyue: "Long ago, an old woman of the Wen clan,
      from Duanxi, made her living by fishing in a stream. One day by the water,
      she found an egg as large as a peck measure and took it home. After about ten
      days, a creature like a gecko, a foot long, hatched and stayed. It grew to
      two feet and could catch over ten fish daily. At five feet, it caught even
      more. It often swam in waves, circling the woman. Once, while cleaning fish,
      she accidentally cut its tail, and it left. Years later, it returned radiant.
      The woman exclaimed: ''Has the dragon son returned?'' It played affectionately
      as before. When Qin Shi Huang heard, he said: ''This is a dragon son, bestowed
      by my virtue.'' He sent envoys with ceremonial jade to summon her. But she
      missed her homeland and was unhappy. At the Xingjiang River, a thousand li
      from Duanxi, the dragon repeatedly pulled the boat back overnight. After several
      attempts, the terrified envoys gave up. When she died, she was buried by the
      river. The dragon son often sent waves to her grave, swirling sand to form
      a mound. People called it the ''Short-tailed Dragon.'' Today, boats are called
      ''dragon-tailed boats'' for this reason."'

    m_Localized: Guangzhou, as an important starting point of the Maritime Silk Road,
      has a long and profound historical status. As early as the Qin and Han Dynasties,
      Guangzhou (then called Panyu) was already the core port for trade between China
      and the countries of the South China Sea. During the reign of Emperor Wu of
      the Han Dynasty, Guangzhou transported silk, ceramics, and other goods via
      maritime routes to India and Sri Lanka, becoming one of the earliest starting
      points. In the Sui and Tang Dynasties, Guangzhou established a Maritime Trade
      Office to manage overseas trade, with its trade routes extending to the Persian
      Gulf and East Africa, becoming the busiest trade center of that time.

    m_Localized: As the core promoters of the ancient Maritime Silk Road in China,
      Guangdong merchants have been engaging in trade activities since the Qin and
      Han dynasties. Guangzhou (formerly known as Panyu) is the main starting point
      and birthplace of the Maritime Silk Road, having already become a distribution
      center for rare items such as pearls, rhinoceros horn, and ivory during the
      Western Han dynasty. The discovery of a Persian silver box and African ivory
      in the tomb of the Nanyue King serves as clear evidence. During the Tang dynasty,
      Guangzhou opened the world's longest maritime trade route, connecting directly
      to the Persian Gulf; under the Qing dynasty's 'Single Port Trade' policy, Guangdong
      merchants monopolized national foreign trade through the Thirteen Hongs, maintaining
      a thousand years of prosperity. Although Xuwen Port on the Leizhou Peninsula
      was one of the early departure ports in the Han dynasty, Guangzhou has always
      remained the core of trade and the foundation for the development of Guangdong
      merchants.

      merchants have continued the commercial genes of the ancient Maritime Silk
      Road, becoming an important practical force. Guangzhou, as the place of inheritance
      of ancient Panyu, remains a core hub of the Belt and Road. Here, Guangdong
      merchants build cross-border trade networks, just like the gathering of pearls
      and ivory in ancient times; now they export home appliances, electronics, and
      other products to countries along the route. The continuous growth of container
      throughput at Nansha Port is a testament to this heritage.
